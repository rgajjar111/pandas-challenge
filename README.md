Summary of Analysis:

**District Summary:**

The total number of unique schools in the district is 15.
The total number of students in the district is 39,170.
The total budget for all schools in the district is $24,649,428.
The average math score across all schools is approximately 78.99.
The average reading score across all schools is approximately 81.88.
The percentage of students passing math (scores greater than or equal to 70) is approximately 74.98%.
The percentage of students passing reading (scores greater than or equal to 70) is approximately 85.81%.
The overall passing rate (students passing both math and reading) is approximately 65.17%.

**School Summary:**

The analysis includes data for each school, such as school type, total students, total budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, percentage passing math, percentage passing reading, and overall passing rate.

**Top and Bottom Performing Schools:**

The top 5 performing schools are sorted based on the '% Overall Passing' rate in descending order.
The bottom 5 performing schools are sorted based on the '% Overall Passing' rate in ascending order.

**Math and Reading Scores by Grade:**

Math and reading scores are calculated for each grade (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) and grouped by school name.

**Scores by School Spending:**

Schools are categorized into spending ranges per student (e.g., "<$585," "$585-630," etc.).
Average math and reading scores, as well as the percentages of students passing math, passing reading, and overall passing, are calculated for each spending range.

**Scores by School Size**:

Schools are categorized into size ranges (small, medium, large) based on the total number of students.
Average math and reading scores, as well as the percentages of students passing math, passing reading, and overall passing, are calculated for each size category.

**Scores by School Type:**

Schools are categorized by type (Charter or District).
Average math and reading scores, as well as the percentages of students passing math, passing reading, and overall passing, are calculated for each school type.

**Conclusions/Comparisons:**

**School Type Comparison:**

One conclusion that can be drawn is that, on average, Charter schools tend to outperform District schools in both math and reading. This is evident from the higher average math and reading scores as well as the higher percentages of passing students in Charter schools compared to District schools.

**Spending Comparison:**

Another conclusion is that higher spending per student does not necessarily result in higher average scores or passing rates. Schools in the spending range "<$585" have similar or even higher average scores and passing rates compared to schools in the higher spending ranges. This suggests that factors other than spending may influence student performance.

These conclusions are based on the analysis provided, and further insights could be gained by exploring additional data and factors that may affect student performance.
